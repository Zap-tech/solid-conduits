For now this repository is pretty empty. I'm hoping to put time into
coming up with and pulling the best contract and library designs and
implementations out of the community and place them here where these
ideas can be battle-tested and documented for use-cases within the
world of blockchain world.

* Programming Tasks

  - [ ] Setup a Test Suite to test the contracts
    Possible Contenders:
